# SCP-3114 Spawner
This Plugin adds SCP-3114 (The Skeleton) to the spawn queue.

# Installation
Download the .dll and place it in the EXILED plugins folder (~/.config/EXILED/Plugins).

# Configuration
The Config is currently still in the default EXILED config file (~/.config/EXILED/Configs/"portnumber"-config.yml).
- Edit the "MinPlayers" option to configure how many players should be on the server to allow SCP3114 to spawn.
- Edit the "SpawnOnTop" option to change if SCP-3114 should spawn "on top" of the existing SCPs (like in the halloween event) and change a Class D to 3114 or if another SCP should be changed instead.
- Edit the "MinPlayersForOnTop" option to change at how many Players the SpawnOnTop option should apply.
- Edit the "SpawnChance" option to change the chance for SCP-3114 to spawn.

# Disclaimer
This is still somewhat WIP so there might be bugs. Also this might mess with the win conditions. If you encounter any issues, feel free to contact me.
